    "Hold on to your data scientist hat but make room for your tester hat.  You'll need both for this section on AI/ML fairness. In these lessons and hands-on activities, you are going to learn how to assess ML models for fairness so that you can identify and quantify fairness-related risks, and employ strategies to mitigate them.  For the hands-on demos and exercises, you'll practice using data processing libraries like _pandas_ and _numpy_, along _seaborn_ for data visualization, to probe training data for fairness-related issues. You'll then get exposure to [Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) and [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/), open-source toolkits for measuring and mitigating fairness-related risks. Since testing is about risk and risk mitigation, the AI/ML and software testing worlds intersect quite naturally here."

    "AI is everywhere and in many ways this is great. However, at the same time, the opportunities brought about by AI also raise new challenges. Some of these challenges have received much attention in the media, and have highlighted the need to \"get AI right\".  Fairness in AI is about making sure that machines do not discriminate against certain groups of people, and possibly place already disadvantaged groups at a further disadvantage.  AI fairness is a fundamentally sociotechnical challenge, meaning that it cannot be approached from purely social or purely technical perspectives. Taken together, these factors can make it a pretty daunting landscape to navigate. Although there are few easy answers, there are a variety of strategies emerging for assessing and mitigating fairness-related risks, as well as a deepening understanding of the challenge throughout society. This tutorial explores these issues and gives you practice using open-source fairness toolkits."

    "\n",
    "Fairness is related, but distinct from anti-discrimination law. In this training, legal terminology like: _discriminate against_, _protected class_, _disparate treatment_ and _disparate impact_ are avoided. Although fairness is related to the concepts in anti-discrimination law, the goal is to focus on fairness and not touch on the legal considerations. It is important to note that some fairness interventions could be illegal, and, conversely, there are AI systems that follow the law, including antidiscrimination law, but still exhibit fairness issues."

    "### Impacts and Risks Instead of Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve read anything about fairness in AI systems then you’ve probably seen the word _bias_ get thrown around. In it's textbook definition, **bias** is a systemic or disproportionate tendency toward something or someone. When it comes to AI, bias is often used as a _catch-all_ phrase for describing any unfair system behavior, or causes of that unfairness. This training avoids using the word bias whenever possible because the term is ambiguous. Bias means very different things to different communities. For example, there is statistical bias, social bias, and systemic bias to name a few.  However, most issues typically arise at the intersection of different types of bias.  For this reason, it is better to talk about the **impacts** or **risks** related to fairness in AI-based systems. Such terms are not only useful for referring to those who may be harmed by the system and in what ways, but also for describing assessment and mitigation strategies. "

    "### Debiasing? No Such Thing\n",
    "I also want to emphasize that because there are so many different reasons why AI systems can cause fairness-related issues, it is not possible to completely remove bias from a system or guarantee its fairness. As a result, throughout this training you aren't likely to encounter terms like **debiasing** or **unbiased**, as they tend to set unrealistic expectations."

    "There are three broad categories of fairness-related risks that can occur in ML models: **allocation risk**, **quality of service risk**, and **representation risk**.  Note that these are not mutually exclusive categories and therefore it is possible for a single AI system to exhibit more than one type of potentially harmful behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Allocation Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of risk may occur when AI systems are used allocate opportunities or resources in ways that\n",
    "can have significant negative impacts on people’s lives. For example, Amazon abandoned its automated hiring system after finding that it amplified the existing gender imbalance in the tech industry by withholding employment opportunities\n",
    "from women.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quality of Service Risk\n",
    "Quality of service risk is about whether a system works as well for one person as it does for another. For example, researchers found that 3 commercial gender classifiers had higher error rates for images of women with darker skin tones, than for images of men with lighter skin tones. Like accessibility issues, quality of service risks can raise questions about respect, dignity, and personhood. Imagine how a user might feel if a system repeatedly fails to recognize her voice, but easily recognizes those of her peers?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Representation Risk\n",
    "Representation risks include things like stereotyping, denigration, and any form of over- or under-representation. Denigration occurs when an AI system is itself part of a process that is actively derogatory, demeaning, or offensive. For example, Google Photos infamously mislabeled an image of Black people as _gorillas_. A similar scenario happened again a few years later when Facebook's AI labeled black men in a video as _primates_. This mislabeling is harmful not just because these system made the same mistake, but because the labels they applied have a history of being purposefully used to denigrate and demean Black people.\n"

    "With potential fairness-related harms identified, it's time to determine who may be at risk of experiencing them. Many times it is the people who will use or operate the system, but somtimes it can be other stakeholders that are directly or indirectly impacted, either by choice or not. For example, in the case of a facial recognition system for workplace building access, the system operator is not the person whose face is being recognized and thus not the person who is most immediately harmed if the system makes a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Search for the Most Relevant Groups\n",
    "Although news and media stories often focus on groups of people that are protected by antidiscrimination laws, such as groups defined in terms of race, gender, age, or disability status, there are actually many different groups of people that we want our systems to treat fairly and it’s not always easy to identify the most relevant ones, which can even be specific to the domain or use case. For example, in the case of an automated essay-grading system, whether someone is a native speaker of the language may be more relevant than their age or their disability status.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Carefully Examine Group Intersections\n",
    "Remember that groups intersect and people at those intersections may be at risk of experiencing unique harms that might be obscured by considering only non-intersected groups. Returning to the image-based gender classifiers mentioned earlier, error rates were significantly higher for women with darker skin tones than for images of women overall, or for images of people with darker skin tones overall. The only way to discover those types of issues are consider the models' performance with respect to skin tone and gender at the same time."

    "Risk quantification is a well-studied subject and you can probably find many tools and resources to help you with this step. The two key components of risk are the **likelihood** (probability) that a given event occurs, and the **severity** of any negative impacts. A common practice for quantifying risks is to use a **risk assessment matrix**.  As shown in the matrix, if there is a high probablity that a risk, if realized, will have a sever impact, then that item should have the attention of the team.  In software testing, the idea behind **risk-based testing** is that you should spend more time validating those aspects of the system that pose the highest threat, and such a philosophy is definitely applicable to testing AI for fairness.\n",

    "When the data set lacks coverage of certain groups, it means that you won't be able to reliably assess any fairness-related issues. There are three possible interventions, which can be combined if needed. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collecting**: gather more data for groups with fewer samples.\n",
    "* **Pooling**: merge some of the groups with fewer samples together to make a larger group.\n",
    "* **Dropping**: removing some of the group with fewer samples altogether (extra caution).\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of strategy depends on your existing understanding of which groups are at the greatest risk of harm. Pooling the groups with widely different risks could mask the extent of harms. You should be extra  cautious against dropping small groups completely as this may leads to the representational harm of erasure. If any groups are merged or removed, these decisions should be annotated and explained. Experimentation is also a useful tool in your toolbelt, so I recommend to approach these issues as both a scientist and a software engineer/tester. For the previous exercise, the recommendations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Drop the gender group labeled *Unknown/Invalid* because the sample size is so small that no meaningful fairness assessment is possible.\n",

One such characteristic is general patient health, where it is reasonable to expect that patients that are less healthy, are more likely to benefit from care management. Although the dataset does not contain full health records for measuring general patient health, it does contain two relevant features on a patient's health during the preceding year.  These are:\n",
    "\n",

    "Recall that the steps in assessing fairness are: identify risks (potential harm), determine which groups might be impacted, quantify risks and compare quantified risks across groups. In this section, I'll walk you through each of these steps and make concrete choices on various aspects of the assessment, so that you can see what is necessary to complete the task.  Immediately afterwards, you'll get hands-on practice using Fairlearn to support these activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risks\n",
    "For the healthcare scenario, the patients that would benefit from the care management program, but are not recommended for it, experience **allocation harm**. In the context of the trained classifier, these are any **false negative** results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potentially Impacted Groups\n",
    "When assessing fairness you should consider demographics, including historically marginalized groups like those based on gender, race and ethnicity. It is also important to consider group intersections, e.g., Black Latin Women. This demonstration will focus on groups defmined by **race**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantified Risks\n",
    "Two metrics will be used for quantifying fairness-related risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **False Negative Rate**: Fraction of patients that are readmitted within 30 days, but that are not recommended for the care management program; this quantifies harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selection Rate**: Fraction of patients that are recommended for the care management program regardless of whether they are readmittted with 30 days or not. Technically, as stated, this quantifies a benefit. However, the assumption is that all patients should benefit similarly from the extra care, but if that does not happen it represents a fairness-related risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk Comparison Across Groups\n",
    "The workhorse of fairness assessment are _disaggregated metrics_, which are **metrics evaluated on slices of data**. For example, to measure harms due to errors, you would begin by evaluating the errors on each slice of the data that corresponds to potentially impacted groups. If some of the groups are seeing much larger errors than other groups, flag this as a fairness harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the disparities in errors, or other metrics, you may want to report quantities such as the **difference** or **ratio** of the metric values between the best and the worst slices. In settings where the goal is to guarantee certain minimum quality of service, it is also meaningful to report the **worst performance** across all considered groups. For example, when comparing false negative rate across groups defined by race, the findings can be summarized in a table like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | false negative rate<br>(FNR) |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| AfricanAmerican | 0.43 |\n",
    "| Caucasian | 0.44 |\n",
    "| Other | 0.52 |\n",
    "| Unknown | 0.67 |\n",
    "| | |\n",
    "|_largest difference_| 0.24 &nbsp;&nbsp;(best is 0.0)|\n",
